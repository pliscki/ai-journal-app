# AI Journal App

AI Journal is a personal journal application designed to help users record their professional activities and leverage AI to generate insights, reports, and assist in resume building. The application serves as a work log and professional reflection tool, allowing users to track their achievements, retrieve past projects, and extract meaningful insights.

## Built with Cursor

This is a project I'm working on with Cursor. I'm using it to learn how to use Cursor and to get a better understanding of the features it offers. I have included the `.cursorrules` file to help with the setup.
